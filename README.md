# Assessing-natural-space-exposure-within-ninety-six-global-cities

1. Run the code in the "step 1: target 1 maps" folder on google earth engine (2 scripts) to create 4 total maps of each of the 96 cities.
2. Run the code in the "step 2: python target 1 data mgmt" folder to convert maps from geotiffs to .csv files where each row represents one pixel.
3. Run the code in the "step 3: stata target 1 ols" folder to run OLS models of target 1 and store the fitted values to a threshold .csv file.
4. Upload the threshold .csv file to GEE.
5. Run the code in "step 4: target 2 maps" folder on GEE (2 scripts) to create 4 total maps of each of the 96 cities.
6. Run the code in the "step 5: python target 2 data mgmt" folder to convert maps from geotiffs to .csv files where each row represents one pixel.
7. Run the code in the "step 6: stata target 2 ols" folder to run OLS models of target 2.
8. Run the code in the "step 7: python graphs" folder to create the graphs used in this paper.
